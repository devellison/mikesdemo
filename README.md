# MikesDemo

This is a demo application I wrote circa 2011, along with a few
libraries I build from about 2001-2011.

It is not production ready, it's ancient pre-C++11 code, 
but it is sometimes a useful example.

The 1.0 release has a Windows 64-bit executable and should be able to
be unzipped and run.

If you have a web camera or other capture device, it should capture
video into the 3D demo window.

The project is set up for Visual Studio 2019 now that I've updated it.
You'll need a Windows SDK (7.0a+, works on Windows 10) and the
legacy DirectXSDK (d3d9tex.lib) installed to compile.

If you find this to be interesting or helpful, let me know ;)

Cheers,
Mike Ellison
