This is a demo application along with a couple of libraries I've
built for my own use over the years.  It is not production ready,
but is a useful example.

The compiled .exe is in .\bin\MikesDemo.exe, and can be run as-is.

If you have a web camera or other capture device, it should capture
video into the 3D demo window.

The project is set up for Visual Studio 2008, and likely requires
a modern Windows SDK (e.g. 7.0a) and DirectXSDK.

If you find this to be interesting or helpful, let me know ;)
